# Default variables for the OpenDaylight role. Override as needed.

# The point of defining default_* and extra_* lists (like default_features
# and extra_features), instead of using one common list (like a features
# list, with the two aggregated) is to simplify the user experience.
# From a playbook using this role, overriding an empty extra_* list and
# ignoring the boring default_* counterpart is easier than appending
# to a common list or enumerating both the ODL-required defaults and the
# extras you actually care about.

# The set of Karaf features installed by default in ODL's release artifact.
# You likely don't need to override these. With only these, you'll be
# able to connect to a Karaf shell and poke around ODL, including
# potentially manually installing features, but that's about it.
# It's better to avoid that manual step by overriding the extra_features
# list with the additional ODL features required by your use-case.
default_features:
  - 'config'
  - 'standard'
  - 'region'
  - 'package'
  - 'kar'
  - 'ssh'
  - 'management'

# Karaf features to install *in addition* to the default_features list.
# You will likely need to override this. The features you choose will
# be determined by your use-case. You'll be able to get a Karaf
# shell and poke around without any extras, but manually connecting to
# CLIs is an anti-goal for CI/CD and automated deployments generally.

# Specifies the port for the ODL northbound REST interface to listen on.
# This was added because OpenStack's Swift project uses a conflicting port.
nb_rest_port: 8080

# Karaf feature repositories configured by default in ODL's release arifact.
# You likely don't need to override these. Override the extra_feature_repos
# list to add custom repos to search for Karaf features.
